        The Fusion Festival is a music and arts festival with a countercultural character. It takes place at a former military airport called Müritz Airpark in Lärz,
        Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, in northeastern Germany. The festival name is often depicted in Cyrillic letters as Фузион, but pronounced like the English word
        fusion. The annual festival was started by the Kulturkosmos organisation in 1997. It lasts four to six days, usually at the end of June. In 2016,
        the Fusion Festival event took place from 29 June to 3 July and which has attracted some 70,000 attendees for each year's festival, since the 2013 event,
        which the comparable American Burning Man event only matched in 2015.
        Different musical styles are represented at the festival, but the line up is not released beforehand. Mostly electronic music is present, but there is no
        stylistic restriction for the various live music acts, and the festival attendees may bring their own instruments. The festival also holds its own film
        festival and features different scales of art installations. Attendees may bring their own art and appear in artistic costumes. Only vegetarian food is
        sold at the festival grounds.
        The festival gears to create a Temporary Autonomous Zone and a transformational environment. Due to its avantgardistic attitude and the variety of art, the
        Fusion Festival has been described as a "European Burning Man".
